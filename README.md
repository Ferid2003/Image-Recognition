# Image-Recognition
This project uses CNN to develop a model for image classification. It can distinguish between 3 animals("Cats","Dogs","Birds") 

NOTE

If you try to create your own model don't download X.picle , y.picle and CNN folder.

However if you just trying to run the model download all the files and just run the imports and last section of code. And don't forget to change folder directories in the code.

You can find all the data in my kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faridaghazada/dogs-cats-and-birds
